  			<div class="p1">Chicken</div>
  			<p>Peel and halve the onions, then chop the leeks, celery and carrots into large chunks. Halve the garlic bulb around the equator.
Put all the ingredients in a large pan with a pinch of sea salt, then cover with cold water.
Place on the hob over a medium heat and bring just to the boil. Reduce the heat to a low simmer, skimming off any scum that rises to the top.
Simmer gently for about 1 hour, or until the juices run clear when you pierce the meat.
Remove the bird from the pan and bubble the poaching liquid for 40 minutes, or until reduced by about one-third (to add more flavour, 
you could strip the meat from the chicken and return the bones to the stock, too).
Sieve the stock, then store in the fridge for up to 1 week.</p>

  			<div class="p2">Beef</div>
  			<p>Over a low heat, sweat the onion in a covered pan with a splash of olive oil until really soft. Remove the lid, increase the heat and add the chilli, tomatoes and a wine glass of water. Season lightly and cook gently for 30 minutes, then break up the tomatoes.
Whiz the bread to breadcrumbs in a food processor. In a large bowl, mix the meats with the nutmeg, the herbs, the zest, the egg yolk and the breadcrumbs. Season and shape into little balls the size of gobstoppers.
Add 3â€“4 tablespoons of olive oil to a hot pan. Brown the meatballs all over, but be careful not to break them up. Then add them to the pan with the tomato sauce, stir carefully, cover, and braise gently for 45 minutes or so until cooked. Serve each portion scattered with a few raw peas, pecorino shavings and marjoram, if using.</p>

  			<div class="p3">Sushi</div>
  			<p>Put the rice in a small saucepan with 375ml water, leave to soak for 30 minutes, then bring to the boil.
Put the lid on and simmer gently for 10 minutes, until the water has been absorbed by the rice.
In a bowl, dissolve the sugar in the vinegar, then sprinkle over the rice mix, combining with a rubber spatula so as not to break up the rice.
Allow to cool for 20 minutes before using.
Deseed or peel the vegetables, then cut into fine strips or batons.
Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat, then spread half the rice over the sheet except for 1cm clear at the top.
Add some vegetables in a horizontal line across the rice.
Begin rolling the mat from the near edge, keeping the filling in place with your fingers. Roll firmly but not too hard.
Remove the roll from the mat and cut into 6 or 8 pieces. Repeat with second piece of nori.</p>
